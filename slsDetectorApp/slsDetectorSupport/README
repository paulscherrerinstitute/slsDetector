This is the slsDetector library compiled from tag 8.0.2 on a RHEL8 Linux PC.
If it is not compatible with your system, or you need a newer version of the library,
follow the steps to build your own.

```
$ git clone --branch 8.0.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/slsdetectorgroup/slsDetectorPackage.git
$ cd slsDetectorPackage
$ cmake -B build
$ cmake --build build
$ cmake  --install build --prefix build/tmp
```

The header files are then copied from *build/tmp/include/sls/* and library files from *build/tmp/lib64/*.
